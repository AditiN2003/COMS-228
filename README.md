This programming assignment involves simulating the profitability of an internet provider named Blaze over the course of a year in a given region represented by an n x m grid. The simulation involves different types of customers (Casual, Streamer, Reseller), empty cells, and outage cells, each with specific update rules based on their neighbors' states. The goal is to compute the profit utilization over 12 billing cycles as a percentage of the maximum potential profit.
